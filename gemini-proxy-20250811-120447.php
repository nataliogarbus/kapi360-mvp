I see a few interesting files in the current directory: `functions.php`, `kapi-custom-logic.js`, and `style.css`. I'll read them to get more context about the project. I will start with `functions.php`.
It seems like you are working with a WordPress theme called "Astra Child". This `functions.php` file is enqueueing the `style.css` file. I will read the `style.css` file next.
This `style.css` file contains custom styles for a WordPress theme. The comments mention "KAPI-STRYKER-DEV", which suggests this is a custom development project. The styles target various elements, including forms, toggles, cards, and FAQs. It seems like a highly customized website.

Now, I'll read the `kapi-custom-logic.js` file.This JavaScript file, `kapi-custom-logic.js`, contains a lot of functionality. Here's a breakdown of what I've found:

*   **particles.js:** It includes the particles.js library for creating animated particle backgrounds.
*   **Style Injection:** It dynamically injects a significant amount of CSS into the page. This is likely to ensure these styles have high priority and are not easily overridden by other stylesheets.
*   **Form Logic:** It handles the logic for a form with the class `.kapi-advanced-form`. This includes:
    *   Validating a URL input.
    *   Toggling the visibility of custom options based on a radio button selection.
    *   Handling form submission, gathering data from the form, and redirecting to a `/informe/` page with the data in the URL.
*   **FAQ Accordion:** It implements an accordion-style FAQ section.
*   **Scroll Animation:** It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to add a `revealed` class to elements with the class `.reveal-on-scroll` when they become visible in the viewport.

Based on the file contents, it seems like you are building a sophisticated, interactive website. The code is well-structured and handles several complex UI features.

I have now reviewed `functions.php`, `style.css`, and `kapi-custom-logic.js`. I have a good understanding of the project. What would you like me to do next?
